### Privacy Sandbox

An initiative to develop technologies that protect privacy and provide tools to build thriving digital businesses:

-   Develop new features to keep your information private.
-   Enable publishers and developers to keep online content free.
-   Collaborate with the industry to build new internet privacy standards.

Privacy Sandbox features are being implemented for both the Web and Android, to phase out third-party cookies, limit covert tracking, and strengthen privacy.
