# Android for Cars overview

Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Bring your app to vehicles running either Android Auto or Android Automotive OS. Use one app architecture that works for both cases so every user can enjoy your app.

## Android Auto

Android Auto provides a driver-optimized app experience for users who have an Android phone with the Android Auto app and a compatible [car or aftermarket stereo system](https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/). They can use your app directly on their car's display by connecting their phone. You enable Android Auto to connect with your phone app by creating services that Android Auto uses to display a driver-optimized interface to the driver.

**Note:** Android Auto is only compatible with phones running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

## Android Automotive OS

Android Automotive OS is an Android-based infotainment system that is built into vehicles. The car's system is a standalone Android-powered device that is optimized for driving. With Android Automotive OS, users install your app directly onto the car instead of their phones.
