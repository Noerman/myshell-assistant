# Guide to Android app modularization

A project with multiple Gradle modules is known as a multi-module project. This guide encompasses best practices and recommended patterns for developing multi-module Android apps.

## The growing codebase problem

In an ever-growing codebase, scalability, readability, and overall code quality often decrease through time. This comes as a result of the codebase increasing in size without its maintainers taking active measures to enforce a structure that is easily maintainable. Modularization is a means of structuring your codebase in a way that improves maintainability and helps avoid these problems.

## What is modularization?

Modularization is a practice of organizing a codebase into loosely coupled and self contained parts. Each part is a module. Each module is independent and serves a clear purpose. By dividing a problem into smaller and easier to solve subproblems, you reduce the complexity of designing and maintaining a large system.

## Benefits of modularization

The benefits of modularization are many, though they each center upon improving the maintainability and overall quality of a codebase. The table below summarizes the key benefits.

| Benefit | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Reusability | Modularization enables opportunities for code sharing and building multiple apps from the same foundation. Modules are effectively building blocks. Apps should be a sum of their features where the features are organized as separate modules. The functionality that a certain module provides may or may not be enabled in a particular app. For example, a `:feature:news` can be a part of the full version flavor and wear app but not part of the demo version flavor. |
| Strict visibility control | Modules enable you to easily control what you expose to other parts of your codebase. You can mark everything but your public interface as `internal` or `private` to prevent it from being used outside the module. |
| Customizable delivery |  uses the advanced capabilities of app bundles, allowing you to deliver certain features of your app conditionally or on demand. |

The benefits above are only achievable with a modularized codebase. The following benefits might be achieved with other techniques but modularization can help you enforce them even more.

| Benefit | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Scalability | In a tightly coupled codebase a single change can trigger a cascade of alterations in seemingly unrelated parts of code. A properly modularized project will embrace the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) principle and therefore limit the coupling. This empowers the contributors through greater autonomy. |
| Ownership | In addition to enabling autonomy, modules can also be used to enforce accountability. A module can have a dedicated owner who is responsible for maintaining the code, fixing bugs, adding tests, and reviewing changes. |
| Encapsulation | Encapsulation means that each part of your code should have the smallest possible amount of knowledge about other parts. Isolated code is easier to read and understand. |
| Testability | Testability characterizes how easy it is to  your code. A testable code is one where components can be easily tested in isolation. |
| Build time | Some Gradle functionalities such as incremental build, build cache or parallel build, can leverage modularity to . |

## Common pitfalls

The granularity of your codebase is the extent to which it is composed of modules. A more granular codebase has more, smaller modules. When designing a modularized codebase, you should decide on a level of granularity. To do so, take into account the size of your codebase and its relative complexity. Going too fine-grained will make the overhead a burden, and going too coarse will lessen the benefits of modularization.

Some common pitfalls are as follows:

-   **Too fine-grained**: Every module brings a certain amount of overhead in the form of increased build complexity and [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code). A complex build configuration makes it difficult to  across modules. Too much boilerplate code results in a cumbersome codebase that is difficult to maintain. If overhead counteracts scalability improvements, you should consider consolidating some modules.
-   **Too coarse-grained**: Conversely, if your modules are growing too large you might end up with yet another monolith and miss the benefits that modularity has to offer. For example, in a small project itâ€™s ok to put the data layer inside a single module. But as it grows, it might be necessary to separate repositories and data sources into standalone modules.
-   **Too complex**: It doesn't always make sense to modularize your project. A dominating factor is the size of the codebase. If you don't expect your project to grow beyond a certain threshold, the scalability and build time gains won't apply.

## Is modularization the right technique for me?

If you need the benefits of reusability, strict visibility control or to use the , then modularization is a necessity for you. If you don't, but still want to benefit from improved scalability, ownership, encapsulation, or build times, then modularization is something worth considering.
