### Multidevice development

We're changing the way you create compelling, cross-device experiences. By designing, building, and delivering a core framework and capabilities that enable devices across the Android devices ecosystem to compound each other's value, we're ensuring that everything works better together.

### Simplified cross-device interactions

To demystify building cross-device experiences, we've built a software stack that abstracts away the underlying connectivity technologies. You no longer need to worry about the  of your users' devices.

### Cross-platform development

We know that developers don't build just for Android. That's why we intend to support cross-platform development, extending beyond Android to cover ChromeOS and other platforms.

### Multidevice use cases

### Personal experiences

-   Rent a movie on your TV by using your phone to enter your payment information.
-   Start reading an article on your phone and finish it on your tablet without losing your place.

### Communal experiences

-   As a passenger, share a map location directly with your friend's car.
-   Share your Sunday bike route with others that you're biking with.
-   Collect items for a group food order without passing your phone around.

### [Announcing Cross device SDK Developer Preview for building rich multi-device experiences on Android](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/07/announcing-cross-device-SDK-Developer-Preview-for-Android.html)

We have launched the Developer Preview of the Cross device SDK for Android. First announced during the Google I/O '22 multidevice development session, the Cross device SDK helps developers to build rich, multidevice experiences by using a simple and intuitive set of APIs. This SDK abstracts away many of the intricacies of working with device discovery, authentication, and connection protocols.

### [CES 2022: Better together with Android and beyond](https://blog.google/products/android/ces2022-bettertogether)

The average U.S. household had 25 connected devices in 2021, up from 11 in 2019. If you're like me, you want to pick and choose the devices that work best for you regardless of brand. You also want to easily set up and move from one device to the next throughout your day, and without having to pull up the same song or task over and over again.

### [Seamless account transfers with Block Store](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/seamless-account-transfers-with-block-store-987a38517311)

The Block Store API allows your app to store user credentials that it can later retrieve to re-authenticate users on a new device. Your credential data is transferred between devices when a user bootstraps one device using another.
