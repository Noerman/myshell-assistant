Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Learn how to preserve your app and user data either as files on the device, in key-value pairs, in a database, or with other data types, and share data between other apps and devices. You can also add a backup service to let users store information in the cloud, sync it across devices, and recover it when they get a new device.
