Ensure that any moments where you choose to monetize are properly integrated into the user experience. For example, don't surprise users with a payment request immediately after your app has loaded, or distract them with ads in the middle of a game level.

If your app or game has a paywall, consider offering free trials for any paid content so that users can make informed decisions on whether to subscribe. If users must pay to make progress in your app or game, make sure you set this expectation prior to installation.

The timing, frequency, and placement of ads are important factors in delivering a high-quality user experience. To ensure that your ads respect users' time, keep their presentation proportional to the rest of your content in duration, frequency, and size.
