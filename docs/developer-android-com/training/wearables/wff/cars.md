### Android for Cars

Build apps that help users connect on the road through Android Automotive OS and Android Auto. Users who have a vehicle with Android Automotive OS can install your app onto their vehicle's infotainment system. Android Auto lets users connect their phone, Android 6.0 or higher, to a compatible vehicle to display a driver-optimized version of your app directly on the console.
