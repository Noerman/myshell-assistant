# Tokenomics

\***WIP\***

**Disclaimer:** MyShell is currently in the testnet phase of development. As such, the details outlined in this whitepaper are non-final and subject to potential future revisions as the project progresses through additional testing and feedback. This document is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute a guarantee or promise.

### **Introduction to $SHELL**

$SHELL is the most important token within the MyShell ecosystem, for accessing premium features, supporting creators, and settling usage charges.

The total supply of $SHELL is 1,000,000,000, which will be gradually released over time. It also includes a burning mechanism, so 1,000,000,000 coins is the hard cap for the total token supply, maintaining a healthful degree of deflation.
