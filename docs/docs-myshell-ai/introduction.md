# Introduction

### Background

In the wave of evolution of artificial intelligence technology, the closed-source model ecosystem has become a notable phenomenon. Led by OpenAI, closed-source models with their powerful performance offer users a range of advanced applications and services. These models are popular for their ability to handle complex data analysis and human-computer interaction tasks, but these achievements come with some lesser-known costs.

-   **Centralization:** The development and operation of closed-source models are highly centralized. In order to gain a competitive edge, closed-source models often build their own ecological fortresses, squeezing the living space of creators. Each closed-source AI model company seeks to define its own technology standards, increasing creators' and developers' dependence on and switching costs to specific models. Moreover, operations and development within the closed-source ecosystem are largely unilaterally controlled by the operating entity, making it difficult for community members to significantly influence the direction and development of the ecosystem.
    
-   **Lack of Incentives**: The existing closed-source model ecosystems rarely provide effective incentives for participants, be they data providers or application developers. The lack of an effective profit-sharing mechanism makes it hard for contributors within the ecosystem to receive rewards commensurate with their labor. This not only reduces the enthusiasm of participants but also suppresses the innovative drive of the entire AI ecosystem.
    
-   **Value Deprivation**: The algorithms of closed-source models and the data they produce are owned by a few companies. The value of the data and the wealth it generates flow mainly to these companies, while individual users and small creators who contribute data receive limited or no return. This model deprives users and creators of control over their data and content, and also limits their potential to benefit from their contributions.
    
-   **Excessive Restrictions**: Closed-source models, operated by companies and serving the public, impose excessive restrictions and adopt a conservative stance. For example, in the area of image generation, closed-source models often add overly restrictive, sometimes unnecessary, limitations. Additionally, the interaction methods of closed-source models are often confined to the boundaries set by the providers. Users and developers are constrained by strict access control and usage terms, limiting the space and potential for innovation.
    

### MyShell Vision

MyShell was born out of a deep reflection on this situation. Our vision is to create a fair and open AI ecosystem, a place where every participant can find their own value.

At MyShell, we advocate for the democratization of AI, including:

-   **Open-Source Models**: Supporting the development of the AI industry with a focus on open-source models, with many contributors promoting the prosperity of AI technology.
    
-   **Ecological Incentives**: Stimulating the vitality and innovative potential of the entire ecosystem through a comprehensive incentive mechanism.
    
-   **Value Redistribution**: Ensuring creators and users receive the benefits they deserve for their data and creations.
    
-   **Free Choice**: Allowing users and developers to freely choose different AI models, without worrying about dependence on and monopolization by a single model. And this is coupled with free choice of choosing decentralized computing and storage.
    

### MyShell Components

MyShell aims to realize this vision through a new ecosystem that includes:

-   **An open and compatible development platform**: Allowing creators to call different models and external APIs using the same method, and enabling third-party model providers and API providers to integrate their services into the platform for developer use. Creators skilled in coding can use native workflows for development, while those less proficient can quickly realize their ideas using the platform's modular interface.
    
-   **A platform promoting application creation and distribution**: An app store that helps creators publish and manage AI applications, where creators can see trends in popular AI applications and purchase advertising to promote their works.
    
-   **A fair reward distribution mechanism**: A transparent reward system for equitably distributing rewards to contributors within the ecosystem, including model providers, application developers, users, investors, etc.
    

In MyShell, every contribution is seen as an indispensable part of the ecosystem, and every innovation has the opportunity to be recognized and rewarded. We invite you to join this revolution and build a new AI era that belongs to everyone.
