Developers choose their preferred contribution levels, whether donations to the community or calibrated entrepreneurial choices. Overall the system aims to sustain continued technique progress accessible to all members.

#### Data Sharing

To further its goal of democratizing AI, MyShell enables community members to openly yet selectively share non-sensitive personal information. This pooled data assists training of generally beneficial models.

Developers needing such data compensate contributions via $SHELL payments. Access requires protocol-set amounts to sustain this resource.
