# How to Obtain Shell Coins

### **Method One: Explorers' Task** Completion

A variety of optional tasks are proposed each season ranging from basic to more involved contributions. By completing tasks such as interacting with bots, providing feedback from different areas, or sharing their experience to help others join, users earn seasonal points which can then be redeemed for Shell Coins token rewards.

The goal of the task program is to engage an ever-increasing number and diversity of participants through friendly challenges. All are encouraged to help in ways that suit their interests and schedules, whether through taking a bot for a test drive, lending their perspective to improve bot operations, or inviting friends on a journey of discovery. Working together through shared ambitions, the MyShell platform aims to benefit from the collective knowledge and goodwill of its vibrant user community.

In simple terms, early investments in a promising creator yield more shares at the same price than late investments.
