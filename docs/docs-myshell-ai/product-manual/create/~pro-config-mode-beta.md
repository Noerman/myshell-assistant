# Pro Config Mode (beta)

MyShell Pro Config is an advanced mode tailored for developers, empowering them to build powerful AI native Apps by assembling AI widgets under a human-controlled structure. It provides a versatile approach that balances human-programmed logic with AI-prompted logic for interaction. **Essentially, it enables developers to architect a state machine for their App.**
