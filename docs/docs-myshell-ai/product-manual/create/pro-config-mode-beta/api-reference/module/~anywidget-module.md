# AnyWidget Module

`AnyWidgetModule` allows you to utilize any widget in our workshop.

It differs from other modules. Apart from `widget_id` and `output_name`, all other fields are specific to the individual widget in use. Consequently, it is not feasible to list field descriptions in advance. However, we can offer examples using common widgets and instructions on how to determine widget configurations.

Please note that the outcomes generated by the `AnyWidgetModule` are contingent on the specific widget and its underlying AI models. Therefore, we are unable to assure that the widget configuration will consistently yield the anticipated results with your setup.

We advise fine-tuning the parameters on the widget webpage and subsequently incorporating them into your Pro Config settings for optimal results.
